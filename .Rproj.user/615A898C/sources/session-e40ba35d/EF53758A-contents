# About

This page consolidates data links and sources for students in CPLN 6890 - The City at Night - at the University of Pennsylvania's Weitzman School of Design, Department of City and Regional Planning.

During the Fall semester of 2025, students will undertake nighttime Area Studies of five Philadelphia sites. Part of this process will involve data analysis of relevant information - public safety incidents, zoning, business licenses, and more.

Many useful data sources are consolidated on this site for ease of access.

# Map of Area Study Sites

The following map shows the five study areas.

You can grab spatial data delineating the boundaries of the study areas as shp (in a zipfile), or as geojson in the "study_areas" folder in the [class GitHub Repo](https://github.com/mafichman/cpln_6890/tree/main/study_areas/2025).


```{r, echo=FALSE,message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, results= 'hide'}
study_areas <- st_read("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mafichman/cpln_6890/refs/heads/main/study_areas/2025/geojson/study_areas_2025.geojson")
```
```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
mapview(study_areas, label = study_areas$Name)

```



# Philadelphia Atlas

[atlas.phila.gov](https://atlas.phila.gov) is a very high quality viewer for many of the data sets mentioned below. It's a great place to start your investigation of your area or to investigate an individual site in detail. It's perhaps the best place to find information about zoning overlays.

# Land Use

[City of Philadelphia Zoning](https://opendataphilly.org/datasets/zoning-base-districts/)

[City of Philadelphia Zoning Overlays](https://opendataphilly.org/datasets/zoning-overlays/)

[City of Philadelphia Special Vending Districts](https://opendataphilly.org/datasets/special-vending-districts/)

You can consult [Section 14-602 of the Philadelphia Code](https://codelibrary.amlegal.com/codes/philadelphia/latest/philadelphia_pa/0-0-0-292339) to understand what kinds of uses are prohibited in each zoning district.

# Licensing

[PA Liquor Control Board Licenses - Philadelphia County](https://github.com/mafichman/cpln_6890/blob/main/plcb_licenses/PHL_PLCB_geocoded.csv)

# Google Places

I pulled data from the Google Places API for several categories - "point of interest", "restaurant", "Night club", and "store" - and then created columns that represent opening and closing times for each day of the week - 0 (Sunday) through 6 (Saturday). There are also true/false columns that represent the point of interest type (e.g. "Restaurant" or "Gas Station")

There are several important considerations about these data:

1. These data extend outside the study boundaries. Use a spatial join or select by location to exclude unwanted data points.

2. The Google Places API is not perfect - I pulled data for a handful of business categories but there are *absolutely* some businesses that were missed in the searches, and there are inaccurate data from user input.

3. Wide data - these are place names, weekly hour schedules, uses/types of business (as a list and as true/false by type), and open/close times for each day in column form.  You may need to clean these data a bit. Places that are open 24 hours show "NA" for closing times in the wide data ... but places that are just plain missing information... also show NA.  You will need to pick through and figure out what's what - deleting the businesses that might happen to be non-operational or just have no relevant listed hours. There are also some places that have multiple closing times on a given day ... for example if you close at 2AM on Saturday night (e.g. 0200 on Sunday), and 11PM on Sunday night (e.g. 2300 on Sunday), you will have multiple times listed for a given day.

4. Long data - these data are similar to the wide data EXCEPT, each place has 7 rows in the data set, one for each day of the week. In this data set, there are columns for hours 0, 1, 2... up to 23, with a 0/1 indicator noting whether the business is open. Again - you might need to clean out businesses that are defunct or don't have relevant "hours", because these show up in the google data just like 24-hour businesses - with no listed open/close times! Be careful to clean those out of your data.
